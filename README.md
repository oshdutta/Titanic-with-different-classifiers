1. Choose same problem-classification problem as before of highest dimension,train kernel machine using SVM idea with existing libraries.
2. Take two problems afresh, all classification, all high dimensional.Atleast one problem on vision dataset, on which apply GMM as generative model to generate new data from that. 
3. Compare SVM kernel result with previous results using other techniques.Use PCA everywhere for data visualizations.
